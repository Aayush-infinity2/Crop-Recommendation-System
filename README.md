# Crop-Recommendation-System

Machine Learning based crop recommedation system that  predicts the crop based on the soil and climatic condition.


##  Project Overview
This Crop Recommendation System uses Machine Learning to help farmers and agricultural planners choose the most suitable crop to cultivate based on inputs like nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, temperature, humidity, pH, and rainfall.

### Live App: https://smart-crop-recommendation-sys.streamlit.app/

### Dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/atharvaingle/crop-recommendation-dataset

## Features
Takes 7 environmental inputs (N, P, K, temperature, humidity, pH, rainfall)

Predicts from 22 crops (like Rice, Wheat, Tea, Cotton, etc.)

Shows crop image, ideal climate, and growing tips

Clean and responsive Streamlit UI

## Tools & Technologies Used
Python 

Machine Learning (Random Forest Classifier)

Streamlit (for UI and deployment)

Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn

Matplotlib & Seaborn (for visualization)

PIL (for image handling)

## Model Details
Algorithm: Random Forest Classifier

Accuracy: ~99.3%

Trained on: 2200+ samples with 22 crop labels

Evaluation: Confusion matrix, classification report, accuracy score

## Sample Input
| Parameter      | Value  |
| -------------- | ------ |
| Nitrogen (N)   | 90     |
| Phosphorus (P) | 42     |
| Potassium (K)  | 43     |
| Temperature    | 25.5°C |
| Humidity       | 80.0%  |
| pH             | 6.5    |
| Rainfall       | 100 mm |

## Output: Recommended Crop → Jute / Rice / etc. (based on prediction)
